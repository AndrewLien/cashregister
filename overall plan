Variables to keep adjustable
- time per item (trained employee) = 1 min
- time per item (trainee) = 2 min
- number of trainees = 1


- "testcases" will contain test inputs, some space-delimited and some tab-delimited (any whitespace)

Breakdown into small tasks...
1. keeping time: have the entire system run on a clock? that ticks every second?
2. adding shoppers to each queue
3. determining how long each shopper will take
    - whether employee is trainee or not
    - how many items the shopper has
4. managing each register's task queue

Store store states as dictionary of lists, where each register is a separate key, and the value of each key is each a customer
every minute, tick down every custumer in all lists by 1, if they're done with their items, remove them from the list.
Or tick them down by 1 sec...
Write a function to add customers to the dictionary... have them join a list (register) becase on what's in that registers list
